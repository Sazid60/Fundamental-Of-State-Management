# Fundamental Of State Management

Welcome to your next journey — Be a Redux Reaper 🔥


Before we dive into Redux itself, it's crucial to master the foundation of state management. That’s exactly what this first module is all about.



🧠 From understanding what state really is, to how it triggers re-renders, works behind the scenes, and when to use useState vs useReducer — we’ll break down the core concepts of state in React like never before.



Whether you're new to state or looking to solidify your fundamentals, this module will sharpen your instincts — so when Redux enters the scene, you’ll already be ahead.

Let’s begin by decoding the essence of UI logic — the State.

## 20-1 What is State? Understanding the Core of UI Logic

#### What is state?
- Sate Means Present situation. Where data is for long run. data is not state

#### Types Of State 
1. Local state (Initially we will deal with local state)
2. remote state 
3. server state 

- When a user comes to a website and takes action the state changes 
- In single page application we just have index.htm and <div id=""> </div> inside it content changes because of state changes like different page appears inside the div.
- React's default state management is not that robust. so fo this reason we use third party state management tool like redux. 
- Here we can say state is current situation's data. based on the state change different interaction happens.
